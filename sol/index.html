			<div class="sec-content"><ul> <li>Paintball:A game where players (in teams) compete to eliminate opponents by shooting them with guns that throw water-soluble dye balls. Build a maze in the college ground with materials from a local exhibition centre. That should give you minimum 5 hours of total fun!</li>
<li>Mad Ads: Though this is a fairly common event, you can add a twist, by first creating totally fake products that are really hard to sell. Like a "smart helmet" or something really dull. Ask them to write the script for the ad, enact it on camera, create a 2-3 minute full fledged ad. Show it on a big projector before ranking them.
